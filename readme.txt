## ⚡ Fun Fact

Did you know that the first-ever computer programmer was Ada Lovelace, a mathematician and writer? She wrote the first algorithm intended to be processed by a machine, earning her the title of the world's first computer programmer...in the 1800s! So, next time you code, remember you're following in the footsteps of a trailblazing mathematician from the Victorian era! 🖥️👩‍💻
